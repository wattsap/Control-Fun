This is a more offensive version of chapter 4's execrise in "Beginning IPhone development with Swift." it highlights how to add labels, text fields(with pre-initialized prompts in them), sliders, toggle buttons, and standard buttons. It also incorporates the use of alert message and action messages. It was a fun project and the book explains things extremely well 95% of the time. It is also a safe bet to assume the %5 left over is user-error on my end.
